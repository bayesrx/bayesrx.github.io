Two goals are to choose important biomarkers that accurately predict treatment outcomes and to cull unimportant biomarkers to reduce the cost of biological and clinical verifications. These goals are challenging due to the high dimensionality of genomic data. Variable selection methods based on penalized regression (e.g., the lasso and elastic net) have yielded promising results. However, selecting the right amount of penalization is critical to simultaneously achieving these two goals. Standard approaches based on cross-validation (CV) typically provide high prediction accuracy with high true positive rates but at the cost of too many false positives. Alternatively, stability selection (SS) controls the number of false positives, but at the cost of yielding too few true positives. To circumvent these issues, we propose prediction-oriented marker selection (PROMISE), which combines SS with CV to conflate the advantages of both methods. Our application of PROMISE with the lasso and elastic net in data analysis shows that, compared to CV, PROMISE produces sparse solutions, few false positives, and small type I + type II error, and maintains good prediction accuracy, with a marginal decrease in the true positive rates. Compared to SS, PROMISE offers better prediction accuracy and true positive rates. In summary, PROMISE can be applied in many fields to select regularization parameters when the goals are to minimize false positives and maximize prediction accuracy.","tags":["Bayesian Integrative models"],"title":"Prediction-Oriented Marker Selection (PROMISE): With Application to High-Dimensional Regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bharath, K","Kurtek, S","Rao, A.","**Baladandayuthapani, V.**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1521086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521086400,"objectID":"bd4787373f06d4732d945ac15ea8db02","permalink":"https://bayesrx.github.io/publication/radimagestatshape-analysis-/","publishdate":"2018-03-15T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/radimagestatshape-analysis-/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a curve-based Riemannian geometric approach for general shape-based statistical analyses of tumours obtained from radiologic images.

Tivantinib, 360 mg orally per dose, was administered twice daily continuously over a 4-week treatment cycle without a cap on the number of allowed cycles, barring undue toxicities or disease progression. Primary objectives were to determine the overall response rate and the toxicities of tivantinib in this patient population. Sixteen patients were enrolled in a two-stage design.

Nonhematological adverse events of grade 3 or higher included hypertension (in four patients); syncope, infection, and pain (two each); and fatigue, cough, and pulmonary embolism (one each). Four of 11 evaluable patients (36%) had stable disease as their best response, while the remainder showed disease progression.

The main interest with these genomic data sets lies in the identification of a subset of features that are active in explaining the dependence between platforms. To quantify the strength of the dependency between two variables, correlation is often preferred. However, expression data obtained from next-generation sequencing platforms are integer with very low counts for some important features. In this case, the sample Pearson correlation is not a valid estimate of the true correlation matrix, because the sample correlation estimate between two features/variables with low counts will often be close to zero, even when the natural parameters of the Poisson distribution are, in actuality, highly correlated. We propose a model-based approach to correlation estimation between two non-normal data sets, via a method we call Probabilistic Correlations ANalysis, or PCAN. PCAN takes into consideration the distributional assumption about both data sets and suggests that correlations estimated at the model natural parameter level are more appropriate than correlations estimated directly on the observed data. We demonstrate through a simulation study that PCAN outperforms other standard approaches in estimating the true correlation between the natural parameters. We then apply PCAN to the joint analysis of a microRNA (miRNA) and a messenger RNA (mRNA) expression data set from a squamous cell lung cancer study, finding a large number of negative correlation pairs when compared to the standard approaches.","tags":["Bayesian Integrative models"],"title":"PCAN: Probabilistic correlation analysis of two non-normal data sets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nieto-Barajas, L","Ji, Y","**Baladandayuthapani, V.**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1469764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1469764800,"objectID":"239bb75cbb8085004bb114094a517a32","permalink":"https://bayesrx.github.io/publication/semiparambayescomparingdnacopynum/","publishdate":"2016-07-29T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/semiparambayescomparingdnacopynum/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a two-step method for the analysis of copy number data.

Standard approaches to this problem use scalar summary measures (e.g., intensity-based histogram statistics) that do not adequately capture the complete and finer scale information in the voxel-level data. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique, DEMARCATE (DEnsity-based MAgnetic Resonance image Clustering for Assessing Tumor hEterogeneity) to explore the entire tumor heterogeneity density profiles (THDPs) obtained from the full tumor voxel space. THDPs are smoothed representations of the probability density function of the tumor images. We develop tools for analyzing such objects under the Fisher–Rao Riemannian framework that allows us to construct metrics for THDP comparisons across patients, which can be used in conjunction with standard clustering approaches.

Statistical inference necessitated the integration of spatially dependent voxel-level measurements with various patient-level genetic and demographic characteristics under an appropriate probability model to account for the multiple inherent sources of variation. Our framework uses Bayesian model averaging to integrate genetic information into the analysis of voxel-wise neuroimaging data, accounting for spatial correlations in the voxels.

We propose a pathway-based differential network analysis in genomics (DINGO) model for estimating group-specific networks and making inference on the differential networks. DINGO jointly estimates the group-specific conditional dependencies by decomposing them into global and group-specific components. The delineation of these components allows for a more refined picture of the major driver and passenger events in the elucidation of cancer progression and development. Simulation studies demonstrate that DINGO provides more accurate group-specific conditional dependencies than achieved by using separate estimation approaches. We apply DINGO to key signaling pathways in glioblastoma to build differential networks for long-term survivors and short-term survivors in The Cancer Genome Atlas. The hub genes found by mRNA expression, DNA copy number, methylation and microRNA expression reveal several important roles in glioblastoma progression.

In addition, simultaneous measurements of genetic and epigenetic characteristics illuminate the roles their complex relationships play in disease progression and outcomes. However, integrative methods for diverse genomics data are faced with the challenges of ultra-high dimensionality and the existence of complex interactions both within and between platforms. We propose a novel modeling framework for integrative analysis based on decompositions of the large number of platform-specific features into a smaller number of latent features. Subsequently we build a predictive model for clinical outcomes accounting for both within- and between-platform interactions based on Bayesian model averaging procedures. Principal components, partial least squares and non-negative matrix factorization as well as sparse counterparts of each are used to define the latent features, and the performance of these decompositions is compared both on real and simulated data. The latent feature interactions are shown to preserve interactions between the original features and not only aid prediction but also allow explicit selection of outcome-related features. The methods are motivated by and applied to, a glioblastoma multiforme dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas to predict patient survival times integrating gene expression, microRNA, copy number and methylation data. For the glioblastoma data, we find a high concordance between our selected prognostic genes and genes with known associations with glioblastoma. In addition, our model discovers several relevant cross-platform interactions such as copy number variation associated gene dosing and epigenetic regulation through promoter methylation. On simulated data, we show that our proposed method successfully incorporates interactions within and between genomic platforms to aid accurate prediction and variable selection.

Such models may improve the accuracy of biological sample classification based on patterns of protein network activation and provide insight into the distinct biological relationships underlying different types of cancer. Motivated by RPPA data, we propose a Bayesian sparse graphical modeling approach that uses selection priors on the conditional relationships in the presence of class information.

In addition, our method allows for intuitive integration of a priori network information directly in the model and allows for posterior inference on the network topologies both within and between classes. Applying our methodology to an RPPA data set generated from panels of human breast cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines, we demonstrate that the model is able to distinguish the different cancer cell types more accurately than several existing models and to identify differential regulation of components of a critical signaling network (the PI3K-AKT pathway) between these two types of cancer.

One of the most common types of high-resolution chromosomal microarrays is array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) methods that assay DNA CNVs across the whole genomic landscape in a single experiment. In this article we propose methods to use aCGH profiles to predict disease states. We employ a Bayesian classification model and treat disease states as outcome, and aCGH profiles as covariates in order to identify significant regions of the genome associated with disease subclasses. We propose a principled two-stage method where we first make inferences on the underlying copy number states associated with the aCGH emissions based on hidden Markov model (HMM) formulations to account for serial dependencies in neighboring probes. Subsequently, we infer associations with disease outcomes, conditional on the copy number states, using Bayesian linear variable selection procedures. The selected probes and their effects are parameters that are useful for predicting the disease categories of any additional individuals on the basis of their aCGH profiles.

Statistical Model: We propose an integrative Bayesian analysis of genomics data (iBAG) framework for identifying important genes/biomarkers that are associated with clinical outcome. This framework uses hierarchical modeling to combine the data obtained from multiple platforms into one model. We assess the performance of our methods using several synthetic and real examples. Simulations show our integrative methods to have higher power to detect disease-related genes than non-integrative methods. Using the Cancer Genome Atlas glioblastoma dataset, we apply the iBAG model to integrate gene expression and methylation data to study their associations with patient survival. Our proposed method discovers multiple methylation-regulated genes that are related to patient survival, most of which have important biological functions in other diseases but have not been previously studied in glioblastoma.","tags":["Bayesian Integrative models"],"title":"iBAG: integrative Bayesian analysis of high-dimensional multiplatform genomics data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bonato, V","**Baladandayuthapani, V.**","Broom, BM","Sulman, EP","Aldape, KD","Do, KA"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1296536400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1296536400,"objectID":"d9f35b462be8dce0525f206ad73a3464","permalink":"https://bayesrx.github.io/publication/fda_bayeensemblesurvpredexpr/","publishdate":"2011-02-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fda_bayeensemblesurvpredexpr/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a Bayesian ensemble method for survival prediction in high-dimensional gene expression data.

Our proposed linear-median method has the power to estimate common changes that appear at isolated single probe positions or very short regions. Such changes are hard to detect by current methods. This new method shows a higher rate of true positives and a lower rate of false positives. The linear-median method is non-parametric and hence is more robust in estimating copy number.

The resulting data consists of log fluorescence ratios as a function of the genomic DNA location and provides a cytogenetic representation of the relative DNA copy number variation. Analysis of such data typically involves estimation of the underlying copy number state at each location and segmenting regions of DNA with similar copy number states. Most current methods proceed by modeling a single sample/array at a time, and thus fail to borrow strength across multiple samples to infer shared regions of copy number aberrations. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian random segmentation approach for modeling aCGH data that utilizes information across arrays from a common population to yield segments of shared copy number changes. These changes characterize the underlying population and allow us to compare different population aCGH profiles to assess which regions of the genome have differential alterations. Our method, referred to as BDSAcgh (Bayesian Detection of Shared Aberrations in aCGH), is based on a unified Bayesian hierarchical model that allows us to obtain probabilities of alteration states as well as probabilities of differential alteration that correspond to local false discovery rates. We evaluate the operating characteristics of our method via simulations and an application using a lung cancer aCGH data set.","tags":["Functional data analyses"],"title":"Bayesian Random Segmentation Models to Identify Shared Copy Number Aberrations for Array CGH Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Navas, M","Ordonez, C","**Baladandayuthapani, V.**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1277956800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1277956800,"objectID":"6ca889bbb79df6253ca9c47ad8feecb4","permalink":"https://bayesrx.github.io/publication/fda_fastpcabayesvarseldb/","publishdate":"2010-07-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fda_fastpcabayesvarseldb/","section":"publication","summary":"Large amounts of data are stored in relational DBMSs. However, statistical analysis is frequently performed outside the DBMS using statistical tools, such as the well-known R package, leading to slow processing when data sets cannot fit in main memory and going through a file export bottleneck. In this article, we propose algorithms for large data set processing of principal component analysis (PCA) and stochastic search variable selection (SSVS) that can work entirely inside a DBMS, using SQL queries and User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Both of our algorithms consist of two main phases: a first phase to compute sufficient statistics in one pass with SQL queries and a second one to derive the model from such such sufficient statistics, in main memory with UDFs. PCA is efficiently solved with SVD via UDFs in main memory after sufficient statistics are derived. On the other hand, the traditional SSVS algorithm requires multiple passes to compute a model. In contrast, our improved Bayesian algorithm performs a single table scan on the input data set and then the UDF performs thousands of iterations on small matrices. In addition, we incorporate optimizations that exploit DBMS multi-threaded processing capabilities to compute multidimensional aggregates in data summarization. Specifically, we present low-level optimizations to distribute the workload among multiple cores, accessing records by block and caching in main memory. Experiments with large data sets results demonstrate the efficiency of our optimizations to compute sufficient statistics and show our algorithms have linear scalability on the size of the data set. Finally, a detailed comparison against R, the standard open-source package for statistical research, shows correctness and superior speed of our DBMS-based algorithms to process very large datasets.","tags":["Functional data analyses"],"title":"Fast PCA and Bayesian Variable Selection for Large Data Sets Based on SQL and UDFs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhou, L","Huang, JZ","Martinez, JG","Maity, A","**Baladandayuthapani, V.**","Carroll, RJ"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1271131200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1271131200,"objectID":"1182a8b94133f92499d52c07d36a8c98","permalink":"https://bayesrx.github.io/publication/fda_reducedrankmixedeffectsspatialcorrelated/","publishdate":"2010-04-13T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fda_reducedrankmixedeffectsspatialcorrelated/","section":"publication","summary":"Hierarchical functional data are widely seen in complex studies where sub-units are nested within units, which in turn are nested within treatment groups. We propose a general framework of functional mixed effects model for such data: within unit and within sub-unit variations are modeled through two separate sets of principal components; the sub-unit level functions are allowed to be correlated. Penalized splines are used to model both the mean functions and the principal components functions, where roughness penalties are used to regularize the spline fit. An EM algorithm is developed to fit the model, while the specific covariance structure of the model is utilized for computational efficiency to avoid storage and inversion of large matrices. Our dimension reduction with principal components provides an effective solution to the difficult tasks of modeling the covariance kernel of a random function and modeling the correlation between functions. The proposed methodology is illustrated using simulations and an empirical data set from a colon carcinogenesis study.

The responses modeled here are essentially functions nested within a two-stage hierarchy. Standard functional data analysis literature focuses on a single stage of hierarchy and conditionally independent functions with near white noise. However, in our experiment, there is substantial biological motivation for the existence of spatial correlation among the functions, which arise from the locations of biological structures called colonic crypts: this possible functional correlation is a phenomenon we term crypt signaling. Thus, as a point of general methodology, we require an analysis that allows for functions to be correlated at the deepest level of the hierarchy. Our approach is fully Bayesian and uses Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for inference and estimation. Analysis of this data set gives new insights into the structure of p27 expression in early colon carcinogenesis and suggests the existence of significant crypt signaling. Our methodology uses regression splines, and because of the hierarchical nature of the data, dimension reduction of the covariance matrix of the spline coefficients is important: we suggest simple methods for overcoming this problem.","tags":["Functional data analyses"],"title":"Bayesian Hierarchical Spatially Correlated Functional Data Analysis with Application to Colon Carcinogenesis","type":"publication"}]
